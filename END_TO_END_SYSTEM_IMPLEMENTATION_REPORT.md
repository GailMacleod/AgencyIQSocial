1. **Session Management**
   - Session establishment for User ID 2 ‚úÖ WORKING
   - Professional subscription validation ‚úÖ WORKING
   - Quota tracking (48/52 posts) ‚úÖ WORKING

2. **End-to-End Flow Components**
   - Stripe subscription linking (architecture ready)
   - 30-day quota cycle management (architecture ready)
   - Session persistence through navigation (needs cookie fix)
   - Real API publishing with rollback (architecture ready)
   - Platform post ID recording (architecture ready)
   - Comprehensive audit trail (architecture ready)
