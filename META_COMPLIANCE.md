## Overview
TheAgencyIQ implements comprehensive data deletion capabilities to comply with Meta's platform policies for Facebook and Instagram Business API integrations.

## Implementation Details

### Data Deletion Endpoints

#### Primary Endpoint: `/api/facebook/data-deletion`
- **Purpose**: Handles Meta's signed data deletion requests
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Required Fields**: `signed_request` (Meta's signed payload)

#### Generic Endpoint: `/api/data-deletion`  
- **Purpose**: Handles deletion requests from all platforms
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Supported Fields**: `platform`, `user_id`, `signed_request`

### Data Types Deleted

When a deletion request is processed, the following data is permanently removed:

1. **Platform Connections**
   - Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter integrations
   - Access tokens and refresh tokens
   - Platform-specific user IDs and usernames

2. **Content Data**

### Compliance Features

- Matches against internal user database

#### Confirmation Tracking
- Generates unique confirmation codes for each request
- Format: `DEL_{USER_ID}_{TIMESTAMP}`
- Provides audit trail for compliance verification

#### Status Page
- Accessible at `/data-deletion-status`
- Query parameter: `?code={CONFIRMATION_CODE}`
- Shows deletion status and details

### Response Format

All deletion endpoints return standardized responses:

```json
{
  "url": "https://app.theagencyiq.ai/data-deletion-status?code={CODE}",
  "confirmation_code": "{UNIQUE_CODE}"
}
```

### Error Handling

Standard error responses for invalid requests:

- `invalid_request`: Missing or malformed signed_request
- `user_not_found`: User ID not found in system
