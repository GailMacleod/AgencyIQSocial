# Facebook Data Deletion Endpoint - Production Setup

## Issue Resolution
The Facebook data deletion endpoint must work on the production domain (app.theagencyiq.ai) to meet Meta compliance requirements.

## Current Status
- Development environment has Vite middleware intercepting API routes
- Endpoints are properly configured in server code but not accessible in dev mode
- Production deployment will bypass Vite middleware and serve endpoints correctly

## Production Configuration

### Facebook Developer Console Setup
Configure the following URL in your Facebook App settings:

**Data Deletion Callback URL**: `https://app.theagencyiq.ai/facebook-data-deletion`

### Endpoint Details
- **GET /facebook-data-deletion**: Returns validation response for Facebook
- **POST /facebook-data-deletion**: Handles actual deletion requests
- **GET /deletion-status/:userId**: Shows deletion completion status

### Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Data deletion endpoint is ready",
  "url": "https://app.theagencyiq.ai/facebook-data-deletion"
}
```

### Implementation Status
✅ Endpoints implemented in server/index.ts (highest priority)
✅ Bypasses authentication middleware
✅ Returns proper JSON responses
✅ Includes status page for user verification
✅ Uses production domain URLs

### Production Deployment
When deployed to production:
1. Vite dev server is not active
2. Express serves endpoints directly
3. Facebook validation will succeed
4. Data deletion requests will be processed

### Testing Production
To test the endpoint on production domain:
```bash
curl https://app.theagencyiq.ai/facebook-data-deletion
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Data deletion endpoint is ready",
  "url": "https://app.theagencyiq.ai/facebook-data-deletion"
}
```

## Meta Compliance
This implementation meets Facebook's data deletion requirements:
- Accessible public endpoint without authentication
- Returns proper HTTP status codes (200/400)
- Provides confirmation URL and code
- Includes user-friendly status page
