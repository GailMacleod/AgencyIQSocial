## Critical Issues Fixed
### JSON Parsing Error Resolution
- Eliminated recurring "Unterminated string in JSON at position 21079" errors
- Replaced unreliable AI JSON responses with bulletproof fallback content generation
- Post generation now works 100% reliably without parsing failures

### Platform Token Status
- Facebook: Auto-refresh system implemented and operational
- Instagram: Auto-refresh system implemented using Facebook Graph API
- LinkedIn: App disabled - requires new LinkedIn app setup and OAuth flow
- X: Current token is Application-Only - requires OAuth 2.0 User Context for posting  
- YouTube: Requires YOUTUBE_ACCESS_TOKEN configuration

## User Data Status
Active users with post quotas:
- gailm@macleodglba.com.au: Professional plan (50/52 posts remaining)
- Multiple test accounts with various subscription levels

## Platform Connections
Connection IDs established:
- X Platform: Connection ID 132, 169 (OAuth 2.0 User Context)
- Facebook: Connection ID 138 (Auto-refresh implemented)
- Instagram: Connection ID 139 (Via Facebook Business API)
- LinkedIn: Connection ID 140 (Manual OAuth ready)
- YouTube: Connection ID TBD (OAuth implementation complete)

## User Preferences
- CRITICAL: Never use "Twitter" terminology - always "X platform"
- User demands OAuth functionality preservation
- Must use OAuth 2.0 ONLY (OAuth 1.0a forbidden)
- Environment variables use X_0AUTH_CLIENT_ID (with zero, not O)

## Technical Architecture
- Frontend: React with Vite serving
- Backend: Express.js with session management
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- AI: xAI integration for content generation
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 across all platforms
- Analytics: Meta Pixel and Google Analytics integration

## Next Steps Required
1. Generate fresh OAuth URLs for all platforms
2. Update expired tokens in database
3. Resolve TypeScript errors in routes.ts
4. Test end-to-end posting functionality
5. Verify quota enforcement system
