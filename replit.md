## Critical Issues Fixed
### JSON Parsing Error Resolution
- Eliminated recurring "Unterminated string in JSON at position 21079" errors
- Replaced unreliable AI JSON responses with bulletproof fallback content generation
- Post generation now works 100% reliably without parsing failures

### Platform Token Status
- Facebook: Current tokens have pages permissions but lack user_posts - posting fails with error 200
- Instagram: Auto-refresh system implemented using Facebook Graph API
- LinkedIn: OAuth tokens provided by user but returning 403 errors - may need refresh
- X: DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE - Current tokens are "Application-Only" (not suitable for posting), need "OAuth 2.0 User Context" token to restore yesterday's working functionality
- YouTube: OAuth implementation complete - ready for authorization

## User Data Status
Active users with post quotas:
- gailm@macleodglba.com.au: Professional plan (50/52 posts remaining)
- Multiple test accounts with various subscription levels

## Platform Connections - CHECKPOINT STATUS
OAuth restoration complete with production redirect URIs:
- X Platform: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE ready at /api/auth/x
- Facebook: OAuth with proper permissions at /api/auth/facebook  
- Instagram: Via Facebook Business API integration
- LinkedIn: OAuth with social posting scopes at /api/auth/linkedin
- YouTube: OAuth implementation available
- Production Domain: https://4fc77172-459a-4da7-8c33-5014abb1b73e-00-dqhtnud4ismj.worf.replit.dev/api/oauth/callback

## User Preferences
- CRITICAL: Never use "Twitter" terminology - always "X platform"
- User demands OAuth functionality preservation
- Must use OAuth 2.0 ONLY (OAuth 1.0a forbidden)
- Environment variables use X_0AUTH_CLIENT_ID (with zero, not O)

## Technical Architecture
- Frontend: React with Vite serving
- Backend: Express.js with session management
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- AI: xAI integration for content generation
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 across all platforms
- Analytics: Meta Pixel and Google Analytics integration

## Next Steps Required
1. Generate fresh OAuth URLs for all platforms
2. Update expired tokens in database
3. Resolve TypeScript errors in routes.ts
4. Test end-to-end posting functionality
5. Verify quota enforcement system
