# TheAgencyIQ - Complete 5-Platform Social Media Automation

## Project Overview
TheAgencyIQ is a comprehensive social media content management platform for Queensland small businesses featuring AI-generated posts using xAI integration. The system provides bulletproof publishing with immediate posting when approved across all five major platforms: Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X, and YouTube.

## Current Status
- **Launch Date**: June 23, 2025 (9:00 AM JST) - ACHIEVED
- **Platform Coverage**: 5/5 platforms integrated
- **Frontend**: React app fully operational
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with all user data intact
- **AI Integration**: xAI Grok-2 models active

## Recent Changes
- **June 24, 2025**: Frontend serving issue resolved - React app now properly loads
- **June 24, 2025**: OAuth callback functionality preserved while fixing routing
- **June 24, 2025**: Debug analysis completed - identified expired tokens across all platforms

## Critical Issues Identified
### Token Expiration Crisis
All platform tokens have expired or been revoked:
- Facebook: Session expired June 22, 2025
- LinkedIn: Access token revoked by user
- X: Credentials not configured
- Instagram: Requires Facebook Business integration renewal

### Database Schema Inconsistencies
- Column naming mismatch between code and database
- Some TypeScript errors in routes.ts need resolution

## User Data Status
Active users with post quotas:
- gailm@macleodglba.com.au: Professional plan (50/52 posts remaining)
- Multiple test accounts with various subscription levels

## Platform Connections
Connection IDs established:
- X Platform: Connection ID 132
- Facebook: Connection ID 138
- Instagram: Connection ID 139
- LinkedIn: Connection ID 140
- YouTube: Connection ID 141

## User Preferences
- CRITICAL: Never use "Twitter" terminology - always "X platform"
- User demands OAuth functionality preservation
- Must use OAuth 2.0 ONLY (OAuth 1.0a forbidden)
- Environment variables use X_0AUTH_CLIENT_ID (with zero, not O)

## Technical Architecture
- Frontend: React with Vite serving
- Backend: Express.js with session management
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- AI: xAI integration for content generation
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 across all platforms
- Analytics: Meta Pixel and Google Analytics integration

## Next Steps Required
1. Generate fresh OAuth URLs for all platforms
2. Update expired tokens in database
3. Resolve TypeScript errors in routes.ts
4. Test end-to-end posting functionality
5. Verify quota enforcement system
