- **âœ… Verified no duplicate certificates** - All certificate numbers unique
- **âœ… Preserved metadata** including codes, plans, and redemption dates

## ðŸ”§ System Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Monitoring
- **âœ… Real-time quota dashboard** - `/api/quota-dashboard` endpoint
- **âœ… Anomaly detection system** - `/api/quota-anomalies` endpoint
- **âœ… Audit trail system** - quota_history table tracks all changes
- **âœ… Automated alerts** for quota exceedances and unusual activity

### 2. Data Cleanup Automation
- **âœ… Automated cleanup service** - DataCleanupService class
- **âœ… Scheduled archiving** - Monthly cleanup capabilities
- **âœ… Retention policy enforcement** - 6-month archiving rules
- **âœ… Orphaned data removal** - Automatic cleanup of invalid references

### 3. User Communication
- **âœ… Quota status display** - Frontend shows accurate remaining posts
- **âœ… Cleanup logging** - Detailed logs in data/quota-debug.log
- **âœ… System transparency** - Users can see exact quota consumption

## ðŸ“Š Final State Verification
