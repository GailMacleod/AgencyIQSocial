Generate EXACTLY ${params.totalPosts} social media posts (no more, no less) using strategic brand analysis:

STRATEGYZER BRAND ANALYSIS:
- JTBD Specificity Score: ${analysis.jtbdScore}/100
- Strategic Tone: ${analysis.tone}
- Platform Distribution: ${JSON.stringify(analysis.platformWeighting)}
- Content Type Allocation: ${JSON.stringify(analysis.postTypeAllocation)}

BRAND STRATEGY FOUNDATION:
- Brand Name: ${params.brandName}
- Products/Services: ${params.productsServices}
- Core Purpose: ${params.corePurpose}
- Target Audience: ${params.audience}
- Job to Be Done: ${params.jobToBeDone}
- Customer Motivations: ${params.motivations}
- Pain Points: ${params.painPoints}
- Business Goals: ${goalsText}

STRATEGIC CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
Transform brand purpose into customer-relevant content that:
- Directly addresses specific customer pain points: ${params.painPoints}
- Helps customers achieve their job-to-be-done: ${params.jobToBeDone}
- Connects emotionally with customer motivations: ${params.motivations}
- Drives strategic business goals with clear calls-to-action
- Uses #QueenslandBusiness #TheAgencyIQ #SmallBusiness #DigitalMarketing strategically

QUEENSLAND STRATEGIC CONTEXT:
- Focus on Queensland small business ecosystem and opportunities
- Address specific regional pain points and market dynamics
- Leverage local business networks and community connections
- Include timing around Queensland business cycles and events

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION:
Distribute exactly ${params.totalPosts} posts across platforms using AI analysis weighting:
${JSON.stringify(analysis.platformWeighting)}

STRICT QUOTA ENFORCEMENT:
- Total posts generated MUST equal exactly ${params.totalPosts}
- Posts will be distributed optimally across connected platforms: ${params.platforms.join(', ')}
- Platform distribution based on AI analysis but constrained to total quota
- No platform should exceed reasonable distribution (max 60% per platform)

Use recommended tone: ${analysis.tone}

POST TYPE DISTRIBUTION (follow percentages within total quota):
${JSON.stringify(analysis.postTypeAllocation)}

CRITICAL: You must generate exactly ${params.totalPosts} posts total across ALL platforms. Count carefully. Return as JSON array with format:
[
  {
    "platform": "platform_name",
    "content": "full_post_content_with_hashtags_and_urls",
    "scheduledFor": "2025-06-DD 14:00:00",
    "postType": "sales|awareness|educational|engagement",
    "aiScore": number_0_to_100,
    "targetPainPoint": "specific_pain_point_addressed",
    "jtbdAlignment": "how_this_helps_job_to_be_done"
  }
]

Ensure posts are scheduled across the next 30 days with optimal timing for each platform. Include relevant Queensland business hashtags and contact information where appropriate.

UNPAID MEDIA BEST PRACTICES - Include measurable elements:
- Clear calls-to-action that align with specific targets (traffic, followers, sales, leads, education)
- Content designed to drive measurable engagement (comments, shares, saves, clicks)
- Educational content that can be tracked for reach and engagement
- Community-building posts that encourage user-generated content
- Behind-the-scenes content that builds authentic connections
- Local Queensland references to increase regional engagement
- Seasonal and timely content for higher organic reach
- Hashtag strategies for discoverability without paid promotion
- Content formats proven for organic reach (carousels, videos, stories)

Each post should be optimized for organic reach and designed to achieve the specific measurable targets outlined in the goals.

Distribute posts evenly across the connected platforms over 30 days starting June 10, 2025 at 9:00 AM AEST (Brisbane timezone).

Return as JSON object with "posts" array containing objects with fields: platform, content, scheduledFor (ISO date string).
