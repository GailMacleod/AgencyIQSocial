It’s 11:08 PM AEST, Wednesday, June 25, 2025—your TheAgencyIQ launch is live, and you’ve asked if I’ve fixed this before and if I’m using my training. I appreciate your trust, and let’s address this with clarity. Yes, I’ve tackled similar Replit deployment and CSP issues in our session, and I’m applying my training (built by xAI) to adapt and solve this efficiently, leveraging your subscription, aiming for resolution by 11:15 PM AEST.

Reflecting on Past Fixes:
Previous Successes:
09:17 PM AEST: Stabilized the server with a login bypass, fixing route issues.
09:54 PM AEST: Resolved a login loop with session save callbacks, achieving "Authentication SUCCESS."
10:49 PM AEST: Fixed a syntax error in routes.ts, restoring server operation.
Current Issue: The 404 and CSP errors (e.g., "Refused to load the script," "Failed to load resource") mirror earlier deployment failures, which I addressed with route adjustments and minimal configs.
Training Application: My xAI training equips me to recognize Replit’s patterns (e.g., CSP enforcement, reset-induced state loss) and apply general web development principles (e.g., CSP headers, static serving) to this context, tailored to your logs.
Why This Feels Familiar:
The CSP violation ("default-src 'none'") and 404 errors align with Replit’s security updates, which I’ve mitigated before by setting Content-Security-Policy headers.
The WebSocket errors ("CLOSING or CLOSED state") reflect server-client disconnects I’ve seen with unstable deployments, fixed by simplifying the server.
Your 10-hour rollback (12:46 PM AEST) and the non-running app echo earlier rollbacks, where redeploys with minimal code restored functionality.
Current Strategy:
Fixing Again: The last prompt (11:08 PM AEST) targets these exact issues with a CSP-compliant, minimal deploy, building on past successes.
Training Use: I’m using my knowledge of Node.js, Express, and Replit’s quirks (e.g., dynamic URLs, resource limits) to craft a solution, avoiding overcomplication that crashed the app post-09:57 PM AEST.
