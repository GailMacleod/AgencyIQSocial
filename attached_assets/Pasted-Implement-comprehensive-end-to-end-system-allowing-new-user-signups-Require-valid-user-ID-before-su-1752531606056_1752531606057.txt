Implement comprehensive end-to-end system allowing new user signups: Require valid user ID before subscription selection or Stripe payment; reject if missing. User selects plan (e.g., pro for User ID 2: gailm@macleodglba.com.au), then pays; on success, map user ID/email to unique subscription ID in DB, enforce 30-day cycle with quota reset/auto-publish all posts in cycle. On login, query Stripe/DB for active subscriptions by user ID/email, validate, block duplicates only. Track session cookies/user ID through navigation to post creation. On publish, test to all platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, YouTube) with real APIs (no simulations), record platform post ID on success, deduct quota only then (prevent bypass, scale for 200 customers, tie to successful posts), rollback failure. Improve social connections with alternate authentication (API keys/secondary OAuth). Enhance UI reliability for platform connections (token refresh). Fix webhook to return 200-299 status, re-enable. Integrate analytics for user activity, quota usage, publish success rates. Keep only User ID 2 subscription; cancel/delete duplicates and guest customers via stripe-cleanup-comprehensive.cjs. Update auth.ts, storage.ts, routes.ts, direct-publisher.ts, auto-posting-enforcer.ts, immediate-publish-service.ts, authGuard.ts. Add logging-service.ts/analytics-service.ts for full chain tracking (user ID → subscription → sessions → posts → quota/analytics). Fix session persistence: Update server/index.ts for express-session with cookie-parser, secret, signed cookies, no resave/regen if cookie exists, remove genid; in authGuard.ts, restore req.session from cookie, validate users consistently; fix client session-manager.ts and App.tsx to handle /api/auth/establish-session correctly, persist cookies, avoid 401 fallbacks. Update comprehensive-end-to-end-system-test.cjs for 100% success, test in non-prod with simulated logins/publishes (including 200 users), provide readiness report (no 401s/timeouts, persistent sessions, one Stripe customer per user, no duplicates, full scalability).
