The end-to-end test script and bug resolution process outlined in the report do partially address connecting platforms to the user ID for gailm@macleodglba.com.au (User ID: 2), but it’s not fully comprehensive for all platform connection scenarios in the same process. Here’s why:

Platform Connection Validation: The report confirms that all five platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, YouTube) are accessible for the subscriber, and the test script includes platform-specific validation (e.g., post creation to Twitter). This implies successful OAuth connections linked to User ID 2, as the analytics and posting functionalities rely on these integrations.
Test Script Coverage: The provided script (endToEndTest.js) tests post creation and analytics, which indirectly verifies platform connections. However, it does not explicitly test the platform connection process (e.g., OAuth flow, token storage, or linking new platforms to the user ID). If the connection process itself has bugs (e.g., token refresh failures or incorrect user ID mapping), these may not be caught.
Bug Resolution Focus: The primary fix targeted the duplicate /api/brand-purpose endpoint, not platform connection logic. The report notes platform connections are operational, but no specific issues (e.g., misaligned user IDs or failed OAuth handshakes) were identified or resolved in this process.
Potential Gaps: The script assumes existing connections are valid. If a platform connection fails to link to the correct user ID during setup (e.g., due to session issues or database errors), or if a user tries to reconnect a platform, the test wouldn’t detect it. The report’s “Platform Integration Testing” section confirms access but doesn’t simulate the connection workflow.
Conclusion: The process validates that existing platform connections work for User ID 2 and supports posting/analytics, but it doesn’t fully test the platform connection setup (e.g., initiating OAuth, storing tokens, or linking to the user ID). To ensure platform connections are robustly linked to the user ID in the same process, extend the test script to include:
