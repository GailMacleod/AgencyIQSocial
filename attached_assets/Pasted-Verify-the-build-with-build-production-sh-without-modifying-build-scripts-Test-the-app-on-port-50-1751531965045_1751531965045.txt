Verify the build with ./build-production.sh without modifying build scripts. Test the app on port 5000; if the frontend fails to load (e.g., blank screen), open server/index.ts, add app.get('/', (req, res) => res.sendFile('dist/index.html', { root: __dirname })); before any serving, then restart with Restarted Start application and retest. Open server/routes.ts, search for all AI generation endpoints (e.g., generateAiPoweredSchedule, /api/auto-post-schedule), and ensure each calls PostQuotaService.hasPostsRemaining() before generation and deductPost(userId, postId) after successful creation, as per the fix from ~03:35 PM AEST, only if not present. Modify the 30-Day Auto-Publishing Enforcer in server/auto-posting-enforcer.ts to validate against PostQuotaService.getRemainingPosts() before publishing, only if not implemented. Finalize server/PostQuotaService.ts with a dynamic 30-day cycle from each customerâ€™s subscription date, enforcing 52 posts per 10 customers (520 total) with postApproved() deducting quota post-publishing, only if not already set. Update server/auto-posting-enforcer.ts to publish 520 posts to platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, X), logging in data/quota-debug.log with /api/notify-expired for failures, only if logic is missing. In client/src/pages/intelligent-schedule.tsx, ensure calendar and list views with AEST timezone display 520 posted contents and add <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'> in index.html if not present, using existing static files. In test/, run npx tsx test-comprehensive-quota-fix.js to ensure 6/6 pass for 10 customers with 520 posts, including 100 concurrent requests and 53-post exceed, replicating the ~03:35 PM AEST validation. In deploy.sh, update to ./build-production.sh && node server/index.js with a pre-check (curl http://localhost:5000/api/health) and post-deployment validation (520 posts visible). Document the exact containment fix from ~03:35 PM AEST, dynamic cycle, and test results in replit.md, avoiding Vite/plugins, build tool edits, or MIME changes beyond the manual serve. Redeploy with ./deploy.sh after 6/6 pass, and manually verify 520 posts on platforms without doubling."
