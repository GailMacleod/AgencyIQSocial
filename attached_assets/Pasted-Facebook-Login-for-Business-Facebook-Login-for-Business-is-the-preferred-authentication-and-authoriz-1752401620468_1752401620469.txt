Facebook Login for Business
Facebook Login for Business is the preferred authentication and authorization solution for tech providers building integrations with Meta’s business tools to create marketing, messaging, and selling solutions.

Facebook Login for Business allows you to create a login experience in the Meta App Dashboard based on the needs of your app. You can specify the access token type, assets, and permissions your app needs, and save it as a configuration. During login your app users are presented with this configuration that allows them to grant your app access to their business assets.

Requirements
Your Meta app must be a business type app
All permissions that your app asks for during login must be granted by your app user or your app won't be granted any permissions.
The email and public_profile permissions are automatically granted to all apps but at least one other supported permission must be included for each app installation.
To serve businesses that you do not own or manage, your app must be approved for Advanced Access via Meta's App Review
Apps with Advanced Access are required to undergo Ongoing Review to retain access. However, apps using Facebook Login for Business have reduced requirements for certain ongoing compliance reviews because they are limited to accessing business permissions and features.

Supported access tokens
You can use Facebook Login for Business to get either Business Integration System User access tokens or User access tokens.

User access tokens
User access tokens should be used if your app takes actions in real time, based on input from the user. For example, use a user access token if your app requires a user to input text and click a button in order to post content to their Page. User access tokens should also be used if you require an API that requires admin permissions on a business portfolio.

Business integration system user access tokens
Business integration system user access tokens should be used if your app performs programmatic, automated actions on your business clients' assets without having to rely on input from an app user, or require re-authentication at a future date. For example:

Hourly, automated server-to-server conversion API calls
Sending automated responses as a Facebook Page or WhatsApp business portfolio
Continuous, automated updates to product catalog inventories
Automated retrieval of ads insights
Requirements
To get business integration system user access tokens from your business clients:

Your app can only request logins from web surfaces
Businesses onboarding to your app must have, or be willing to create, a business portfolio
Your app must be associated with a business portfolio, which you have full control. This needs to be separate from the business portfolio owned by your business client.
To test the business integration system user access token flow, the tester must have a role on the app and full control of the client business.

Granular business integration system user access tokens
If you need different access setups for different purposes or departments, you can use multiple granular business integration system user access tokens per client business to improve the scalability and security of your integrations.

Granular access tokens are still specific to a client business portfolio. They are not shareable and accessible across different client businesses. Their scope and asset list are a subset of the original business integration system user access token.

To isolate potential security incidents in the event of a compromised token, only that specific client business will be impacted, instead of impacting all business portfolios across all client businesses.


Comparison
Business Integration System User access tokens	User access tokens
Access Designations

Access is explicitly delegated at the time of authorization. Your app can only access the assets that were designated by your business client when they completed the Facebook Login for Business flow. Tech Providers only.

Access is inherited from your app user's current account access; your app can access the same business assets that the app user currently has access to.

Account association

Associated with your business client's business portfolio rather than a specific user. Any admin in your business client's admin group can grant your app a system user access token.

Associated with your app user's personal Facebook account.

Expiration and refresh

Defaults to never expire for the common offline server-to-server communication.

A short-lived token for online activities such as web browsers.

OAuth grant type

Authorization Code grant only.

Implicit grant by default, and can support authorization code grant for improved security. Mainly used for user-agent based clients such as web browsers and mobile apps.

Representation

Part of the Tech Provider integration's infrastructure, initialized by a client business through Tech Provider’s app installation.

Represents servers or software making API calls to assets owned or managed by a Business Manager.

Token Invalidation

Your business clients can invalidate business integration system User access tokens by going to Business Manager > Settings > Business Settings > Integrations > Connected apps and removing your app.

Your business clients can invalidate User access tokens by going to Facebook and navigating to Settings & privacy > Settings > Security and login > Business Integrations and removing your app.

Business Integration System User Access Token Management API
When a client business installs an app through Facebook Login for Business and generates a business integration system user access token, the token includes a client business ID. This ID represents the client business and is used by your app to make API calls.

Get a client business ID
To get a client business ID from the business integration system user access token, send a GET request to the /me endpoint with the fields parameter set to client_business_id and the access_token parameter to your app user's business integration system user access token.

curl -i -X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/me \
  ?fields=client_business_id
  &access_token=<BUSINESS_INTEGRATION_SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>”
On success your app receives a JSON response with your app user's client business ID.

{
  "client_business_id": "<CLIENT_BUSINESS_ID>",
  "id": "<APP_SCOPED_ID>"
}
Get tokens
The /<CLIENT_BUSINESS_ID>/system_user_access_tokens endpoint allows you to manage your existing business integration system user access tokens. Actions include:

Generate granular business integration system user access tokens from the existing business integration system user access tokens
Fetch any existing business integration system user access tokens
Parameters
Object	Description
access_token string

Required. This access token requires the business_management permission

appsecret_proof string

Required. The appsecret_proof is a sha256 hash of your access token ensuring API calls are from a server are more secure.

asset int

Optional. When you want to generate a more granular token, you can set a list of asset IDs, separated by commas. The list of assets will have to be a subset of assets from the original access token.

fetch_only bool

Optional. The flag you want to use to fetch the existing token and indicate this operation is read only

scope bool

Optional. When you want to generate a more granular token, you can set a list of scope ids, separated by a comma. The list of assets will have to be a subset of scopes from the original access token.

set_token_expires_in_60_days bool

Optional. When you generate a new token, set to true so that the token expires in 60 days.

system_user_id int

Optional. The ID for the system user included in the access token.

Sample request
Formatted for readability.

curl -i -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/<CLIENT_BUSINESS_ID>/system_user_access_tokens
    ?appsecret_proof=<APPSECRET_PROOF_HASH>
    &access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>
    &system_user_id=<SYSTEM_USER_ID>
    &fetch_only=true"
On success your app receives a JSON response with a new access token to be used in subsequent API calls.

{
  "access_token": "<NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>" 
}

Get started
The following are the steps required to set up Facebook Login for Business if you don't already have an app.

Create an app
In Meta's App Dashboard, create a Business type app.
Add the Facebook Login for Business product.
In the left side menu select Configurations.
You can either + Create configuration to create a configuration or Create from template to select one of Meta's preset configurations. You can create multiple configurations and present them to different sets of users.
Name your configuration
Choose the type of access token you want to request from your business clients, a User access token or System-user access token and token expiration. If you select User access token then your app users will log in using their personal Facebook account. If you select System-user access token your app users will be required to log in using a business portfolio. This is only required if this configuration needs continuous access to business assets, such as Facebook Pages, ad accounts or Instagram accounts.
Select all the assets your app needs access to.
Select the permissions your app needs and click Create.
You will receive a Configuration ID that you will use in your code to invoke the login dialog.

Create a WhatsApp Business Platform Embedded Signup configuration
To create a WhatApp Embedded Signup configuration, visit our WhatsApp Embedded Signup guide.

Create a Conversions API for Business Messaging configuration
To create a Conversions API for Business Messaging configuration, visit our Marketing API – Conversions API for Business Messaging guide.

Create an Instagram Graph API configuration
To create an Instagram Graph API configuration, visit our Instagram Graph API documentation.

Invoke a login dialog
Invoke a login dialog using one of our SDKs (recommended) or manually build your login flow.

Invoking with our SDKS
You can use any of our SDKs to invoke the login dialog by replacing the list of scopes (permissions) your app needs with your configuration ID and the access token's required OAuth grant type.

If you are unfamiliar with our SDKs, we recommend that you first install the JavaScript SDK and get it working with the consumer Facebook Login product before proceeding, as the following examples reference the SDK.

Business integration system user access token configurations
Here's an example of the JavaScript SDK's FB.login() method modified to use a configuration for a System User access token. Note that config_id has replaced scope (which should not be used), the response_type has been set to code, since SUAT's require the authorization code grant type, and override_default_response_type must be set to true. When true, any response types passed in the response_type will take precedence over the default types.

FB.login(
  function(response) [
    console.log(response);
  ],
  [
    config_id: '<CONFIG_ID>',
    response_type: 'code',
    override_default_response_type: true
  ]
);
When the user completes the login dialog flow we will redirect the user to your redirect URL and include a code. You must then exchange this code for an access token by performing a server-to-server call to our servers.

GET https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/oauth/access_token?
  client_id=<APP_ID>
  &client_secret=<APP_SECRET>
  &code=<CODE>
See Exchanging Code for an Access Token for more information about this step.

User access token configurations
Here's an example of the JavaScript SDK's FB.login() method modified to use a configuration for a User access token. Note that config_id has replaced scope (although scope can still be included, we recommend that you do not use it).

FB.login(
  function(response) {
    console.log(response);
  },
  {
    config_id: '<CONFIG_ID>' // configuration ID goes here
  }
);
Here's an example of the JavaScript SDK's login button modified to use a User access token configuration:

<fb:login-button config_id="<CONFIG_ID>" onlogin="checkLoginState();">
</fb:login-button>
Build a manual login flow
See Manually Building the Login Flow to learn how to invoke the login dialog manually. When invoking the login dialog and setting the redirect URL, include your configuration ID as an optional parameter (although scope can still be included, we recommend that you do not use it).

config_id=<CONFIG_ID>
Switch to Facebook Login for Business
It is recommended you conduct testing and learn about potentially encountered problems before switching to Facebook Login for Business.

Facebook Login for Business is available to Business type apps.

If your app is eligible to switch to Facebook Login for Business, you should be able to see an opt in banner by the following steps:

Select your app in the App Dashboard
Go to or add the Facebook Login product
Click either Settings or Quickstart in the left side menu
Click the “Get started with Facebook Login for Business” button at the top of the page.
Note that your current access tokens will not be impacted upon switching to Facebook Login for Business. Additionally, any test app(s) associated with this app will also switch to Facebook Login for Business.

After switching, your app type will be under Business type. If your app is not functioning as intended, each app is allowed to roll back to Facebook Login within 30 days after the switch.

Troubleshooting
Business clients might encounter error messages for the following reasons:

Config ID is invalid
Business System User Access Token is not currently supported on Mobile devices
Business System User Access Token is set up with incorrect response_type
Potential breaking changes:

If your app type is currently None, switching to Facebook Login for Business will change your app’s type to Business and will only retain access to the permissions, features and products listed above.
If you request permissions or features from business clients that Facebook Login for Business doesn’t support, those permissions and features will be revoked immediately once you switch your app to Facebook Login for Business.
If you only request email and/or public_profile from your business clients, switching the app to Facebook Login for Business will lead to the invalidation of all previously installed tokens for these clients.
If your app has both Facebook Login for Business and Meta Business Extension, the Meta Business Extension experience will be limited to permissions supported by Facebook Login for Business.
Business Asset User Profile Access may affect how user profile data is accessed and managed through our APIs.
Note that if the login dialog for Facebook Login for Business is invoked via configuration id, and if you decide to rollback to Facebook Login, the login dialog might fail to load as Facebook Login does not support the config_id parameter and you need to replace the config_id parameter with the scope parameter instead.
