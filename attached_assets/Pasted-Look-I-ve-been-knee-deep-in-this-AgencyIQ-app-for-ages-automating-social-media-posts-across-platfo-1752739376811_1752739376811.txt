Look, I've been knee-deep in this AgencyIQ app for ages, automating social media posts across platforms in Replit, and I'm over the endless debugging loops. We've got OAuth for logins, session and cookie management to keep users authenticated without dropping, quota tracking to avoid API bans, scheduled auto-posting based on user queues, customer onboarding with sign-ups and verifications, and all that interconnected crap we discussed. But now the console's spewing errors left and right: CORS blocks on heroicons scripts, Tailwind warnings screaming about production misuse, 404s on images like agency_logo_verified_1752714177165.png and others, 400/401 fails on /ai/auth, /establish-session, and /user endpoints suggesting auth and session breakdowns, connection retries exceeding with "Unable to connect" promises, permissions policy violations on things like payment and unload, repeated 503 Service Unavailable on the main app URL, MIME type mismatches on module scripts, aria-label accessibility nags everywhere, iframe sandbox escapes, and silent fails that probably tie into quotas not enforcing, auto-posts ghosting, onboarding glitches, OAuth redirects flaking, and cookies not persisting securely. The whole thing's a mess—sessions expiring randomly, quotas not tracking, posts failing without logs, onboarding bombing on edges.

Reverse-engineer this nightmare from the error logs and our prior code piles. End goal: A rock-solid, scalable app that handles hundreds of users autonomously, with bulletproof auth/sessions/cookies, quota limits that actually work without bans, reliable auto-posting schedules, seamless onboarding pipelines, flawless OAuth integrations, error handling that logs and recovers gracefully, and easy feature adds without implosions. No rigid steps—just diagnose the root causes across all these areas, then spit out a clear plan on how to fix and optimize it all, including phases, code fixes/snippets, Replit-specific tweaks, and any dependency swaps to make it hum without these blowups. How do we get there?
