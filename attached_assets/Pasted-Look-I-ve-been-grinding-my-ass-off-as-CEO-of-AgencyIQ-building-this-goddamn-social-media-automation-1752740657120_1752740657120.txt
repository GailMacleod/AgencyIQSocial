Look, I've been grinding my ass off as CEO of AgencyIQ building this goddamn social media automation monster in Replit—OAuth for logins that don't flake, sessions and cookies that persist without vanishing into the ether, quota managers to keep us from getting API-banned like idiots, auto-posting schedules that actually fire without silent fails, onboarding pipelines for customers that sign up and verify without glitching on every edge case, and all the tangled code we've been slinging back and forth. But now the console's puking these SyntaxErrors: "Unexpected token '<'" over and over in main.tsx (lines like 1:1415, 1:1512, etc.), right after some Meta Pixel init crap from eruda.js. This screams that the server's serving up HTML bullshit instead of proper JS modules—probably starting with a '<' from a doctype or tag—causing module loads to bomb, which cascades into auth breakdowns, session drops, quota checks not running client-side, auto-posts stalling, and onboarding UIs rendering jack shit.

Reverse-engineer this clusterfuck from our existing code heap: Figure out why Replit's serving HTML for main.tsx and other scripts (likely a routing screw-up, build config fail in Vite/React, static serving without proper MIME like 'application/javascript' instead of 'text/html' or octet-stream, or .replit deployment quirks). Diagnose ties to our broader messes—OAuth redirects not hitting, cookies not setting, quotas not enforcing, posts ghosting, onboarding bombing. Then, spit out a no-nonsense fix plan: Tweak server configs (e.g., Express middleware for correct Content-Type headers), adjust vite.config.js or build scripts for proper outputs, Replit-specific hacks like custom run commands or env vars, code snippets to patch routing/static serves without breaking sessions/cookies/OAuth/quotas/posting/onboarding, and tests to verify it scales for hundreds of users autonomously with graceful error handling.

End goal: App loads clean without these syntax bombs, runs bulletproof and feature-ready without more goddamn back-and-forth. How do we smash this and integrate seamlessly? Break it down into phases with examples.
