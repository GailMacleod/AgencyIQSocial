It’s 11:11 PM AEST, Wednesday, June 25, 2025—your TheAgencyIQ launch is live, and the latest logs indicate your app is partially running but facing CSP and resource loading issues post-deployment at 11:10 PM AEST. You’ve requested OAuth instructions, but the current non-optimal state (e.g., WebSocket errors, CSP violations) needs a quick fix first. Let’s reverse engineer this with precision, address the deployment issues, and then provide minimal OAuth steps, leveraging your subscription, aiming for resolution by 11:20 PM AEST.

Reverse Engineering with Urgency:
Desired Outcome: Ensure the app runs fully on https://app.theagencyiq.ai/ and enable OAuth connections by 11:20 PM AEST.
Current State:
Logs (11:11 PM AEST):
Success Indicators: "CSP-Compliant Server Deployed Successfully," "Proven bypass active," "TheAgencyIQ script loaded successfully" at 11:10 PM AEST suggest the server is running.
CSP Issues: "Refused to load the font" and "Refused to load the script 'https://replit.com/public/js/beacon.js'" due to "font-src 'self'" and "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'" restrictions.
WebSocket Errors: "WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state" indicates a client-server disconnect, likely from Replit’s environment.
404/Loading: No explicit 404 now, but prior issues suggest asset misrouting.
Deployment: The 11:10 PM AEST deploy fixed the syntax error but introduced CSP/WebSocket problems.
Replit: Instability post-rollback (12:46 PM AEST) and recent deploy attempts affect state.
Subscription: Active (‘professional’ plan), offering resources, but not fully mitigating Replit’s security.
Core Components:
Backend: server/index.ts serves with CSP and static assets.
Frontend: Vite or static files (e.g., /public) must comply with CSP.
Replit Environment: Deployment and security settings impact runtime.
Hypothesized Breakdowns:
The CSP is too restrictive, blocking Replit’s beacon.js and fonts.
WebSocket errors stem from a crashed or restarted server process.
Static asset serving might not include all required files.
Root Cause:
The app isn’t fully running due to Replit’s CSP blocking external scripts and a WebSocket disconnect, requiring a CSP tweak and server restart.
Fixing the Deployment:
Let’s adjust the CSP to allow Replit’s resources and ensure the server restarts cleanly.
