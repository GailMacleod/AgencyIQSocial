•  Updated Prompt: "In Replit, open client/src/pages/payment.tsx, add a console log before the payment form submission to check if the logged-in user’s email is 'testuser@agencyiq.com' and the card number is '4545454545454545'. If true, prevent the real Stripe submission, log 'Mock payment successful for testuser@agencyiq.com with 4545454545454545', update only this user’s state to include subscriptions { starter: true, growth: true, professional: true } using the current user context, and add a flag 'isTestMode' to enable this mock only for this user. If false, proceed with normal Stripe submission and log 'Live payment attempted'. Commit with message 'add-secure-mock-payment' without deploying. Ensure no unauthorized changes beyond this addition." 
•  Instructions: 
1.	Open client/src/pages/payment.tsx in Replit (create if absent, mimicking your payment form with a card input and user context, e.g., from a global state or session).
2.	Apply the updated prompt as written.
3.	Add a check (e.g., if (currentUser.email === 'testuser@agencyiq.com' && cardNumber === '4545454545454545')) before the Stripe payment method call, where currentUser.email is from your app’s auth state (adjust based on your implementation, e.g., Redux, Context).
4.	If true, log console.log('Mock payment successful for testuser@agencyiq.com with 4545454545454545');, set isTestMode: true in the user context, and update subscriptions: { starter: true, growth: true, professional: true } for this user only.
5.	If false, log console.log('Live payment attempted'); and proceed with Stripe.
6.	Save the file.
7.	Go to the Git tab, commit with "add-secure-mock-payment" (do not deploy).
8.	Visit https://agency-iq-social-GailMac.replit.app/payment (or navigate via the app), log in as testuser@agencyiq.com with TestPass123!”, enter 4545454545454545 with any future date and CVC (e.g., 12/30, 123), submit, check console for the mock log and verify subscription access at 08:21 AM AEST.
9.	Report the outcome (e.g., mock log present, subscriptions active for test user only) and any issues.
•  Validation: 
•	If no log appears, ensure currentUser.email is accessible (e.g., from your auth provider) and the card input is captured.
•	If subscriptions update for other users, verify the user context isolation (e.g., use a user-specific ID check).
•	If the live payment triggers, confirm the if condition logic.
•	Confirm, report Replit overreach.
