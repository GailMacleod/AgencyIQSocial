. Cookies and Session Management – Solid Persistence, But Browser Tests Reveal Access Flaws and Inconsistencies
What's Working: The new browser-session-test.cjs confirms browser-like access (with User-Agent headers) works for session establishment—/api/establish-session hits 200 OK with data for gailm@macleodglba.com.au. It uses tough-cookie to simulate cookie jars, and platform connections fetch succeeds post-session. This aligns with prior browser-refresh-consistency-test.cjs (100% persistence across tabs/refreshes). authenticated-test-publish.js also establishes sessions via POST and grabs cookies successfully. Cleanup summaries claim "Secure session management" with HTTPOnly flags.
What's Broken:
Browser Access Restrictions: In browser-session-test.cjs, direct /api/user access without session returns errors (likely 401/403, based on "Error Message: Unauthorized" patterns from tools and prior docs). But the test logs show inconsistencies—e.g., platform connections sometimes fail with "ERROR" if cookies aren't perfectly propagated, hinting at Replit's flaky proxying. Cross-origin issues persist; no consistent CORS in new API routes, echoing old apiModule.ts problems.
Session Loss in Tests: authenticated-test-publish.js checks connections but logs "❌ Failed to get platform connections" if auth fails—evidence of session drops mid-flow, especially in browser sims. Tool searches confirm Replit's cloud compute can kill sessions without proper keep-alives, and prior action-plan report noted "Inconsistent Handling in OAuth Flows."
Security Gaps Still Linger: Despite "CODE_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md" claiming "Session Security: HTTPOnly cookies with secure flags," prior middleware audits showed fallback user IDs (e.g., || 2), and new tests don't validate against them. No idle timeout/refresh logic, per my prior simulation needs.
Fix Suggestions: Enforce CORS on all API endpoints in apiModule.ts (e.g., res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*') for dev, tighten for prod). Add session refresh via JWT in establish-session endpoint, with 30min idle timeouts (inspired by tool results on Node.js OAuth storage). Test with Python sim via tool (but since it's JS, manually: extend browser-session-test.cjs to poll every 5min). Remove any remaining fallbacks—grep for "|| [number]" and nuke 'em. Align with cleanup MDs by actually implementing rate limiting (100/min as claimed).
