DYNAMIC VIDEO PROMPT GENERATION SYSTEM GUIDE

HERO CHARACTER STORY ARCS Craft hero journeys on-the-fly from brand purpose and JTBD: Visualize Queensland SME owners evolving from pain to triumph. Dynamically adapt: Stressed founder discovers automation spark, transforming empty workspace into thriving hub with witty "aha" moments. Pull from real-life scenarios—late nights fade to confident strides, customer floods in via clever reveals. Infuse mature humor: "From invisible to invincible—watch the glow-up!" Trigger arcs based on keywords like "growth" for scaling tales or "digital" for tech awakenings, always tying to audience motivations.
PLATFORM ADAPTATIONS Tailor visuals fluidly: Instagram—vertical, TikTok-energy bursts; YouTube—horizontal cinematic flows; Facebook—square social vibes; LinkedIn—professional polish; X—snappy horizontal punches. Auto-adjust aspect ratios and pacing for platform-native engagement.
NARRATIVE FLOW ENGINE Build stories with emotional rhythm: Start with raw struggle (furrowed brows, chaos swirling); pivot to discovery (eyes widen, spark ignites); build to action (hands orchestrate change, systems hum); peak at transformation (success blooms, crowd cheers); end on uplift (hero beams, future bright). Weave in Queensland flair—sunlit offices, local events—for relatable punch.
VISUAL DYNAMICS Ignite with quick 1-2s cuts, sweeping cams capturing expressions and reveals. Layer dramatic yet warm lighting, bold colors, and upbeat tracks. Theme evolves: Neon pulses for tech, sleek glass for corporate—always vibrant, no static frames. Focus on JTBD impact: Show "peace of mind" as waves calming stormy seas, not desks.
ARC SELECTION PROCESS AI scans inputs (JTBD, pains, goals) to spin custom arcs: "Automation" sparks efficiency epics; "expertise" builds authority legends. Default to core transformation if vague, ensuring every video feels alive, tied to brand's unique solve.
PROMPT OUTPUT BLUEPRINT Generate prompts that pulse with life: Include adaptive formats, hero evolutions, emotional beats, dynamic actions, visual flair, and local context. End with authenticity calls: "Make it scroll-stopping, aspirational, and humor-infused for Queensland SMEs chasing visibility."
