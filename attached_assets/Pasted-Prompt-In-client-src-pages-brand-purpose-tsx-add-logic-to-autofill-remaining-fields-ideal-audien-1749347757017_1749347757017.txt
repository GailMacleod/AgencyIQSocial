      motivation: "20% sales growth, 10 hours/week saved, standout digital presence.",
      painPoints: "Invisible online, time scarcity, skill gaps, low engagement.",
      goals: "500 visitors/month (https://theagencyiq.ai), 15% engagement increase, 10 leads/week."

};

document.getElementById('corePurpose')?.addEventListener('input', autofillFields);
Assumptions: Field IDs match (brandName, valueProp, corePurpose, audience, motivation, painPoints, goals). Adjust IDs if different.
Steps:
Open client/src/pages/brand-purpose.tsx in preview.
Apply the code snippet at the end of the file.
Fill "What’s your brand name?" (e.g., "The AgencyIQ"), "What products or services does your brand offer?" (e.g., value prop text), and "What’s your brand’s core purpose?" (e.g., AgencyIQ purpose).
Type in the core purpose field and watch for autofill.
Check console for "Fields autofilled" log at 11:57 AM AEST.
Precision Notes:

This targets only the autofill trigger after the third field, using a static AgencyIQ template as a starting point.
No server changes or deployment, preserving your live setup.
Confirm autofill works without errors at 11:57 AM AEST.
