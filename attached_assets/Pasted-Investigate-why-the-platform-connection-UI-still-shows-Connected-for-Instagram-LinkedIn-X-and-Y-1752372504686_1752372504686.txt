Investigate why the platform connection UI still shows "Connected" for Instagram, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube despite expired OAuth tokens, while the claimed fix should display "Expired - Reconnect". Perform these checks without modifying code, providing verifiable evidence (e.g., exact code snippets, API responses, database query results, browser console logs):





Inspect the getConnectionStatus function: Extract and provide the full code snippet. Verify if it prioritizes oauthStatus.isValid over database existence, including token expiration logic (e.g., compare expires_at with current time). If not, detail discrepancies.



Review UI rendering logic in the frontend component (e.g., client/src/pages/platforms.tsx): Provide the relevant code snippet for badge and button rendering. Confirm if it uses connectionStatus to display "Expired - Reconnect" (red badge) for invalid tokens. Reproduce failure: Describe steps to load the page and capture browser console output showing stale rendering.



Analyze database entries for platforms: For User ID 2, query and provide exact values for OAuth fields (e.g., access_token, refresh_token, expires_at) for each platform. Confirm expiration by comparing expires_at to current time (July 13, 2025). Include SQL query used and raw results.



Test OAuth validation: Manually call /api/platform-status for each platform via curl or Postman; provide full request/response (headers, body). Report token invalidity and any errors. Simulate edge case: Force an expired token scenario and re-test.



Check for caching or stale data: Inspect TanStack Query config (e.g., staleTime in useQuery); provide code snippet. Clear cache/session storage, reload UI, and log before/after states. Provide browser dev tools screenshots or logs showing cache interference.



Verify recent changes: Compare current code to previous versions (provide git diff or line-by-line changes for getConnectionStatus and UI logic). Confirm deployment: Check server logs for build timestamp and active code version. Reproduce inconsistency: Step-by-step guide to trigger "Connected" display with expired tokens.

Chain validations: Start with database check, then API call, then code inspection, then UI load. Provide a detailed report with all evidence, failure reproduction steps, and root cause analysis focusing on discrepancies. Do not claim fixes; assume persistence until proven otherwise.
