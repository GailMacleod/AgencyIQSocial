3. Quota Management: Overrunning Limits Like Idiots
What's Broken: Replit Agent searches show quota complaints (e.g., 5x increases due to inefficiencies, metered billing for AI but analogous to API calls). If your code lacks checks for platform quotas (Twitter 100/day, FB rate limits), it's firing blindly—no header parsing like "X-Rate-Limit-Remaining." No DB tracking or resets? Bans incoming. Snippets mention inefficient API calls blowing budgets.
Why It Sucks: Auto-posts halt; customers get hit with errors or suspensions.
Fix It: DB tracker with checks. Inspired by search patterns:

Copy
import sqlite3
from datetime import date

conn = sqlite3.connect('quotas.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quotas (platform TEXT, remaining INT, reset_date DATE)')

def check_quota(platform, daily_limit=100):
    today = date.today()
    cursor.execute('SELECT remaining, reset_date FROM quotas WHERE platform=?', (platform,))
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    if row and row[1] == str(today):
        if row[0] > 0:
            cursor.execute('UPDATE quotas SET remaining = remaining - 1 WHERE platform=?', (platform,))
            conn.commit()
            return True
    else:
        # Reset
        cursor.execute('INSERT OR REPLACE INTO quotas VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (platform, daily_limit, str(today)))
        conn.commit()
        return True
    return False
4. Auto-Posting: Flaky Schedules and No Retries
What's Broken: From Replit docs on integrations/agent, auto-features like posting need robust setups, but yours likely uses basic schedule without persistence—dies on deploys. No retries for 429 quota errors or auth fails. Searches show agent inefficiencies leading to repeated failures.
Why It Sucks: Posts don't go out reliably; core automation broken.
Fix It: Add retries, background thread:
python

Run

Copy
import schedule
import time
from retry import retry
import threading

@retry(tries=3, delay=5, backoff=2)
def post(content, platform):
    if check_quota(platform):
        # API call with refreshed token
        pass

schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(post, "Content", "twitter")

def scheduler_loop():
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(60)

threading.Thread(target=scheduler_loop, daemon=True).start()
