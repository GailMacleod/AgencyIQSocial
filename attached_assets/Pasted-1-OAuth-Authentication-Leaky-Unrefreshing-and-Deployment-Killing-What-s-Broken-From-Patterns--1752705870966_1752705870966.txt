1. OAuth Authentication: Leaky, Unrefreshing, and Deployment-Killing
What's Broken (From Patterns & Tool Gaps): Searches on similar repos highlight OAuth woes—e.g., missing refresh tokens leading to constant re-auths (per Auth0 GitHub snippets), no PKCE for security, and Replit-specific callback failures due to proxy/HTTPS mismatches. Since my tools couldn't pull any code, I'm betting yours lacks DB persistence (Replit DB or env) for tokens, so deploys wipe everything. No error handling for "invalid_grant" or scoped requests? Platforms revoke access fast. Multi-platform support (Twitter/FB/Insta) probably inconsistent, with hardcoded keys risking leaks.
Why It Sucks: Onboarding stalls on auth loops; auto-posts crash on expired tokens, chewing quotas unnecessarily.
Fix It: Add refresh and storage. Hypothetical patch (inspired by searched snippets):
python

Run

Copy
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session
from replit import db

def initiate_oauth(platform):
    oauth = OAuth2Session(client_id=db['client_id'], redirect_uri='YOUR_CALLBACK', scope=['post', 'read'])
    auth_url, state = oauth.authorization_url(f'https://api.{platform}.com/oauth/authorize')
    return auth_url, state

def handle_callback(platform, code):
    oauth = OAuth2Session(client_id=db['client_id'])
    token = oauth.fetch_token(f'https://api.{platform}.com/oauth/token', code=code)
    db[f'{platform}_token'] = token  # Persist
    return token

def refresh_token(platform):
    token = db[f'{platform}_token']
    oauth = OAuth2Session(client_id=db['client_id'], token=token)
    new_token = oauth.refresh_token(f'https://api.{platform}.com/oauth/token')
    db[f'{platform}_token'] = new_token
I'd execute this in my code tool to test flows, but... no code.
2. Sessions and Cookies: Vanishing in Replit's Void
What's Broken: Reddit threads from searches scream about session drops in Replit Flask apps—cookies blocked by SameSite/iframe issues, no secure flags, leading to login loops. Your code likely uses basic session without filesystem/Redis backing, so restarts kill state. No auto-renewal for expiries? Onboarding data poofs mid-step. Tool emptiness suggests no JWT fallback or URL params for resilience.
Why It Sucks: Users can't stay logged in; auto-posting loses context, quotas waste on re-sessions.
Fix It: Persistent sessions with checks:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
from flask_session import Session
app.config['SESSION_TYPE'] = 'filesystem'
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE'] = 'Lax'  # Or 'None' with secure
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
Session(app)

@app.before_request
def renew_session():
    if 'expires' in session and time.time() > session['expires']:
        refresh_token(session['platform'])  # Tie to OAuth
        session['expires'] = time.time() + 3600
3. Quota Management: Running Blind into Walls
What's Broken: Searched repos like ayrshare show proper quota fetches via API endpoints, but yours probably skips it—no pre-post checks for remaining limits (e.g., Twitter's headers). No DB for tracking/resets? Overruns lead to 429 errors. Tool void means no evidence of platform-specific logic (FB vs. Insta limits).
Why It Sucks: Auto-posts fail en masse; customers get banned, blame us.
Fix It: DB-based tracker:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('quotas.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quotas (platform TEXT, remaining INT, reset_time DATETIME)')

def update_quota(platform, limit=100, reset_hours=24):
    now = datetime.now()
    cursor.execute('SELECT remaining, reset_time FROM quotas WHERE platform=?', (platform,))
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    if row and (now - datetime.fromisoformat(row[1])) < timedelta(hours=reset_hours):
        return row[0] > 0 and cursor.execute('UPDATE quotas SET remaining=remaining-1 WHERE platform=?', (platform,))
    else:
        cursor.execute('INSERT OR REPLACE INTO quotas VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (platform, limit-1, now.isoformat()))
    conn.commit()
    return True
4. Auto-Posting: Schedules That Ghost You
What's Broken: Patterns from Replit integrations show flaky threading—jobs die on deploys without persistence. No retries for quota/auth fails. Searches highlight inefficient posting loops blowing resources.
Why It Sucks: The app's heart—automation—stops beating reliably.
Fix It: Robust scheduler:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
import schedule
import time
from retry import retry
import threading

@retry(tries=3, delay=10)
def auto_post(content, platform):
    if update_quota(platform):
        # Refreshed OAuth post call
        pass

schedule.every(60).minutes.do(auto_post, "Scheduled content", "twitter")

def run_schedule():
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

threading.Thread(target=run_schedule, daemon=True).start()
5. Customer Onboarding: A Drop-Off Disaster Zone
What's Broken: No seamless flows per searched tutorials—likely clunky forms losing data on session drops, no guided OAuth or verification. Tool blank means no evidence of multi-step persistence or email hooks.
Why It Sucks: Friction kills sign-ups; no customers, no money.
Fix It: Session-backed steps:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
@app.route('/onboard/step1', methods=['POST'])
def step1():
    session['data'] = request.form
    return redirect('/onboard/step2')  # With OAuth trigger
Wrap-Up: This Invisible Mess Is Killing Us
Hypothetically, the app's a 3/10—brittle, insecure, unreliable, all the crap we've ranted about. But without code, it's just hot air. My tools confirm the repo's effectively empty to the world. Paste the files NOW, or this back-and-forth ends with nothing built. AgencyIQ could be printing money, but not like this. Your move—give me the code.
