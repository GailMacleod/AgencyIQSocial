Your Instagram App ID displayed in App Dashboard > Products > Instagram > Basic Display.

redirect_uri
Required
String

https://socialsizzle.herokuapp.com/auth/

A URI where we will redirect users after they authenticate. Make sure this exactly matches one of the base URIs in your list of valid oAuth URIs. Keep in mind that the App Dashboard may have added a trailing slash to your URIs, so we recommend that you verify by checking the list.

response_type
Required
String

code

Set this value to code.

scope
Required
Comma-separated list

user_profile,user_media

A comma-separated list, or URL-encoded space-separated list, of permissions to request from the app user. user_profile is required.

state
String

1

An optional value indicating a server-specific state. For example, you can use this to protect against CSRF issues. We will include this parameter and value when redirecting the user back to you.

Response
The Authorization Window, which you should display to the app user. Once the user authenticates, the window will redirect to your redirect_uri and include an Authentication Code, which you can then exchange for a short-lived Instagram User Access Token.

Note that we #_ append to the end of the redirect URI, but it is not part of the code itself, so strip it out before exchanging it for a short-lived token.

HTTP Example
https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize
  ?client_id=990602627938098
  &redirect_uri=https://socialsizzle.herokuapp.com/auth/
  &scope=user_profile,user_media
  &response_type=code
Successful Authorization
If authentication is successful, the Authorization Window will redirect the user to your redirect_uri and include an Authorization Code. Capture the code so you can exchange it for a short-lived access token.

Codes are valid for 1 hour and can only be used once.
