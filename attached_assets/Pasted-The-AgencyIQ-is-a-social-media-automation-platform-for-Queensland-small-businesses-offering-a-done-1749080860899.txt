The AgencyIQ is a social media automation platform for Queensland small businesses, offering a “done-for-you” solution. It follows a waterfall approach: Payment/Signup → Brand Purpose → Platform Connections → Schedule Generation → Publishing with Approval. All posts are auto-generated at the start of the 30-day cycle (no rollover) using Strategyzer’s brand purpose and Grok-enhanced algorithms. The app must be visually stunning (Airbnb-inspired), fully automated, user-friendly, and launch-ready today, June 05, 2025, by 11:59 PM AEST.

Analytics: Grok shows insights in Schedule Screen banner (e.g., “linkedin posts had 20% higher engagement”).
Backend Logic
Database:
Users: id, email, phone, password (hashed), subscription_plan, subscription_start, remaining_posts, total_posts.
Posts: id, user_id, platform, content, status, published_at, error_log.
Platform_Connections: id, user_id, platform, access_token, refresh_token, connected_at.
Brand_Purpose: id, user_id, core_purpose, audience, goals.
Cycle Start (e.g., June 05, 2025, 09:45 AM AEST):
Set remaining_posts to 12/27/52 based on plan (Starter/Growth/Professional), Posts table: 12/27/52 posts (status: “Scheduled”).
/api/generate-content-calendar auto-generates posts using brand purpose.
Publishing: /api/schedule-post updates status, only successful posts deduct from quota.
Stripe Integration:
Product Codes: STRIPE_PRICE_ID_STARTER, STRIPE_PRICE_ID_GROWTH, STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PROFESSIONAL (from app secrets).
/api/create-checkout-session, /api/webhook/stripe handle payments.
Twilio Integration: Uses TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN for SMS verification.
SendGrid Integration: Uses SENDGRID_API_KEY for forgot password email (logs link in test mode).
