Verify the build with ./build-production.sh without modifying build scripts. Test the app on port 5000 to confirm functionality. Open server/index.ts, locate the CSP header (e.g., res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', ...)) or middleware, and update it to allow font loading with font-src 'self' data: https://fonts.gstatic.com; to fix 'Refused to load the font' errors, and ensure static files (e.g., /public/manifest.json) are served without 403 by adding app.use(express.static('public')); if not present, then restart with Restarted Start application and retest. Ensure server/PostQuotaService.ts maintains a dynamic 30-day cycle from each customerâ€™s subscription date, enforcing 52 posts per 10 customers (520 total) with postApproved() deducting quota post-publishing, and PostQuotaService.hasPostsRemaining()/deductPost(userId, postId) from ~03:05-03:35 PM AEST are active, only reinforcing if missing. Update server/auto-posting-enforcer.ts to publish 520 posts to platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, X), logging in data/quota-debug.log with /api/notify-expired for failures, only if logic is incomplete. In client/src/pages/intelligent-schedule.tsx, ensure calendar and list views with AEST timezone display 520 posted contents, fix the DialogContent warning with aria-describedby={description || 'dialog-description'} if a description is available, and ensure <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'> in index.html. In test/, run npx tsx test-comprehensive-quota-fix.js to ensure 6/6 pass for 10 customers with 520 posts, including 100 concurrent requests, 53-post exceed, and API tests. In deploy.sh, update to ./build-production.sh && node server/index.js with a pre-check (curl http://localhost:5000/api/health) and post-deployment validation (520 posts visible across all platforms). Document the CSP/403 fix, dynamic cycle, and test results in replit.md, avoiding Vite/plugins, build tool edits, or MIME changes beyond the static serve. Redeploy with ./deploy.sh after 6/6 pass, and manually verify 520 posts on all platforms."
