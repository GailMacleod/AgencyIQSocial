Precision Fix with Redeploy:

Minimal Deploy: Strips routes and complex logic, focusing on a working bypass to avoid the server error.
Checkpoint: ‘Post-Error Redeploy’ at 10:33 PM AEST for safety.
No Disruption: Defers OAuth and login fixes, preserving core access.
Root Cause: Targets the 9-hour-old deployment’s instability, likely from the crash, with a lightweight recovery.
Next Steps:
In Replit, redeploy the app with this prompt, overwriting the 1:33 PM AEST deployment.
Test the bypass at 10:33 PM AEST by visiting https://app.theagencyiq.ai/public.
Submit the logs.
If it works, we’ll rebuild OAuth; if not, rollback or reset.
