address recurring OAuth UI bug from yesterday: Platforms show "Connected" with expired tokens; LinkedIn shows "The application is disabled". Despite prior "fixes", issue loops due to unverified changes and no token refresh logic.

Manual Replit edits: Use file editor for code changes (e.g., server/routes.ts, client/src/pages/platforms.tsx); run npm install if deps needed; restart server via Replit controls.

First principles: Tokens expire for security; app must validate (expires_at < now), refresh via refresh_token, update UI dynamically. For LinkedIn, verify app ID/secret valid, not revoked.

Steps without assuming fix:





Establish session: POST /api/login {email: "gailm@macleodglba.com.au", password: "testpass"}; capture cookie. Provide full response/log.



Investigate: Query DB for User ID 2 OAuth data (access_token, refresh_token, expires_at per platform); provide SQL/results. Call /api/platform-status per platform with session; provide curl commands/responses showing expiration/errors.



Fix getConnectionStatus: Add expiration check (if expires_at < Date.now() && !refreshTokenValid(), return {isValid: false}). Implement refresh: Use platform SDK to renew token if refresh_token exists, update DB. Provide exact code diff/snippet.



Fix UI (platforms.tsx): Use useQuery to fetch status; render red "Expired - Reconnect" badge/button if !isValid. Add onClick for reconnect initiating OAuth flow. Provide code diff.



Handle LinkedIn "disabled": Check app credentials in code/env; simulate auth flow; if revoked, log error. Provide verification steps.



Test: Reconnect one platform (e.g., X); force expiration in DB (set expires_at past); reload UI; provide logs/screenshots showing "Expired - Reconnect".



Edge cases: Simulate concurrent access, token revocation; reproduce yesterday's loop (e.g., stale cache); provide failure steps if persists.

Chain: Session > DB/API investigate > Code fixes with diffs > Deploy/restart > Retest UI/API > Evidence (logs, responses, diffs). Do not claim fixed without all proofs; focus on discrepancies to break loop.
