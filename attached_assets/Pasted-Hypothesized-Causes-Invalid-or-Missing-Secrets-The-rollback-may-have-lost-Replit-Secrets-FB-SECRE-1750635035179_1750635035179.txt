Hypothesized Causes:
Invalid or Missing Secrets: The rollback may have lost Replit Secrets (FB_SECRET, LI_SECRET, etc.), or they’re outdated/expired, causing fetch calls to fail silently. The fallback test_secret in prior prompts isn’t functional for real APIs.
API Misconfiguration: Endpoints (e.g., /api/waterfall/approve, /api/enforce-auto-posting) might use incorrect URLs, headers, or payloads (e.g., text field mismatch per platform API requirements), leading to 400 Bad Request or unlogged errors.
CSP Impact: The blocked Facebook scripts could disrupt token validation or post tracking, cascading to all platforms if shared logic exists.
Execution Block: The autopost trigger might not fire due to a timing issue, unhandled exception, or lack of a persistent queue, leaving posts in a "published" state without action.
Rollback Regression: The revert to June 17 code likely reintroduced a bug (e.g., missing token refresh, broken platform logic) that the forced publish temporarily bypassed.
Root Cause Deduction:
The primary failure is invalid or missing platform secrets combined with misconfigured API calls. The CSP violation exacerbates this by blocking Facebook integration, but the core issue is the publishPost function failing due to unauthenticated or malformed requests. The "published" status update without platform reflection (second image) suggests the code updates the local state (e.g., approved-posts.json) but doesn’t verify or execute the API call successfully. The forced publish success (first image) indicates credentials can work with manual intervention, pointing to an automation gap.
Verification Plan:
Check Replit Secrets for FB_SECRET, LI_SECRET, IG_SECRET, TW_SECRET—are they present and valid?
Review server/index.ts publishPost function for correct platform URLs and payloads.
Test a single fetch call with a known secret to confirm API connectivity.
Prompt to Fix:
Open server/index.ts and locate the /api/waterfall/approve and publishPost function. Replace only these blocks with a fix to ensure successful platform posting, preserving all other code:
