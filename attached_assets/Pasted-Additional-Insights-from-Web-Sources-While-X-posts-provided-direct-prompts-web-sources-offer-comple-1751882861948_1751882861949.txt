Recommendations for App Training
To optimize your app for short-form video generation across platforms:

Platform-Specific Customization:
TikTok: Prioritize trendy, entertaining content with hooks under 3 seconds. Use music-driven prompts (e.g., “Sync visuals to a trending sound”).
Instagram Reels: Focus on polished visuals, tutorials, or lifestyle content with strong CTAs (e.g., “Link in bio”).
YouTube Shorts: Emphasize educational or motivational content with clear text overlays for skimmability.
Prompt Structure:
Train your app to include: Hook (3-5 seconds), Core Message (20-40 seconds), CTA (5-10 seconds).
Use variables for [niche], [audience], [platform], and [product/service] to make prompts reusable.
Hashtag and Engagement Features:
Integrate an AI-powered hashtag generator (inspired by vistasocial.com) to suggest trending, niche-specific hashtags.
Add prompts for interactive elements (e.g., “Ask a question to spark comments”).
Visual and Audio Integration:
Combine prompts with tools like Canva or AI video generators (e.g., Appy Pie) for automated visual creation.
Train your app to suggest trending audio tracks for TikTok and Reels.
Iterative Refinement:
Allow users to refine prompts (e.g., “Make it shorter,” “Add emojis”) based on Buffer’s AI features (zapier.com).
Use analytics to prioritize prompts that drive engagement (e.g., comments, shares).
