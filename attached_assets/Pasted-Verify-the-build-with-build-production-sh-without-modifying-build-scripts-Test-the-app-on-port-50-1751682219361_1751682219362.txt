Verify the build with ./build-production.sh without modifying build scripts. Test the app on port 5000 to confirm functionality. Open server/index.ts, enhance the existing beacon.js endpoint at /public/js/beacon.js to return a minimal JS file (e.g., res.send('console.log("Beacon loaded");');) with CORS headers (res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/javascript');) if not set, and add app.use(express.static('public')); to serve /public/manifest.json with HTTP 200, fixing the 403 error, then restart with Restarted Start application and retest. Ensure server/PostQuotaService.ts maintains a dynamic 30-day cycle from each customerâ€™s subscription date, enforcing 52 posts per 10 customers (520 total) with postApproved() deducting quota post-publishing, and PostQuotaService.hasPostsRemaining()/deductPost(userId, postId) from ~03:05-03:35 PM AEST are active, only reinforcing if missing. Update server/auto-posting-enforcer.ts to publish 520 posts to platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, X), logging in data/quota-debug.log with /api/notify-expired for failures, only if logic is incomplete. In client/src/pages/intelligent-schedule.tsx, ensure calendar and list views with AEST timezone display 520 posted contents, fix the DialogContent warning with aria-describedby={description || 'dialog-desc'} if a description exists, and ensure <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'> in index.html. In test/, run npx tsx test-comprehensive-quota-fix.js to ensure 6/6 pass for 10 customers with 520 posts, including 100 concurrent requests, 53-post exceed, and API tests. In deploy.sh, update to ./build-production.sh && node server/index.js with a pre-check (curl http://localhost:5000/api/health) and post-deployment validation (520 posts visible across all platforms). Document the 403/beacon.js fix, dynamic cycle, and test results in replit.md, avoiding Vite/plugins, build tool edits, or MIME changes beyond the static serve. Redeploy with ./deploy.sh after 6/6 pass, and manually verify 520 posts on all platforms."
