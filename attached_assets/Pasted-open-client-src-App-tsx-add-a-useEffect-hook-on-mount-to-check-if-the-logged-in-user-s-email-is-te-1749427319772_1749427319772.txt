open client/src/App.tsx, add a useEffect hook on mount to check if the logged-in user’s email is 'testuser@agencyiq.com'. If true, update the user’s state to { subscriptions: { starter: true, growth: true, professional: true }, postLimits: { starter: 14, growth: 29, professional: 54 } } and log 'Test user full access granted for testuser@agencyiq.com with password TestPass123!" to verify post limits match tiers (14, 29, 54)'. Ensure this runs only once on app load and does not rely on external systems. Commit with message 'client-init-test-user-accurate-limits' without deploying. Ensure no unauthorized changes beyond this addition."
Instructions:
Open client/src/App.tsx in Replit.
Apply the updated prompt as written.
Add useEffect(() => { if (currentUser.email === 'testuser@agencyiq.com') { setUserState({ subscriptions: { starter: true, growth: true, professional: true }, postLimits: { starter: 14, growth: 29, professional: 54 } }); console.log('Test user full access granted for testuser@agencyiq.com with password TestPass123!" to verify post limits match tiers (14, 29, 54)'); } }, [currentUser.email]); with setUserState matching your state management (e.g., setState, context dispatch), assuming currentUser is from your auth provider.
Save the file.
Go to the Git tab, commit with "client-init-test-user-accurate-limits" (do not deploy).
Visit https://agency-iq-social-GailMac.replit.app (test locally or post-deploy), log in as Username: testuser@agencyiq.com and Password: TestPass123!", check console for the log and verify post limits (14 for Starter, 29 for Growth, 54 for Professional) in the schedule page at 10:02 AM.
Report the outcome (e.g., log present, correct post limits active) and any issues.
Validation:
If the log appears but post limits don’t match (e.g., 54 for all), ensure your app’s logic uses postLimits per subscription (e.g., check if (subscriptions.professional) postLimit = postLimits.professional).
If subscriptions don’t update, verify setUserState integrates with your state (e.g., Redux dispatch).
If live users are affected, confirm the email check is strict.
Confirm, report Replit overreach.
